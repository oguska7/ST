# Herding in the Social Media

A good portion of stock price swings can be explained by herd behavior - a phenomenon in which traders
intentionally ignore their beliefs in order to mimic someone else's action.

mutual mimicry among investors may temporarily move asset prices away from fundamental values, 
which in turn would increase the spread around the mean.
